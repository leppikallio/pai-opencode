# Deferred Features

**Features from PAI 2.4 that are not in PAI-OpenCode v1.0, and when they're coming**

---

## Overview

PAI-OpenCode v1.0 focuses on **core functionality**—skills, agents, security, memory. Some advanced features from PAI 2.4 (Claude Code) are **deferred to future releases** to ensure a stable, well-tested foundation.

## 1. Voice Server (TTS Notifications)

**Status:** Deferred to v1.1
**Priority:** P1 (High)

### What It Does

The Voice Server provides **text-to-speech notifications** for:
- Task completion alerts
- Error notifications
- Session milestone announcements
- Long-running command completion

### Why Deferred

- Requires macOS-specific audio setup (`say` command)
- Need to verify OpenCode plugin can emit events
- Audio device selection needs testing

### Workaround (v1.0)

Voice line still appears in responses:
```
🗣️ Jeremy: Task completed successfully.
```

But no audio playback. Format preserved for v1.1.

## 2. Observability Dashboard

**Status:** Deferred to v1.2
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)

### What It Does

The Observability Dashboard provides **real-time monitoring** of:
- Active sessions
- Tool usage metrics
- Security events
- Learning capture
- Agent invocations

### Why Deferred

- Vue + Vite build system needs OpenCode testing
- Event capture requires plugin `tool.execute.after` testing
- Real-time SSE needs validation

### Workaround (v1.0)

View events manually:
```bash
cat .opencode/MEMORY/raw-outputs/2026-01/*.jsonl | jq
```

---

## 3. Auto-Migration

**Status:** Deferred to v1.x
**Priority:** P3 (Low)

### What It Does

Auto-Migration provides **automatic updates** from Claude Code PAI:
- Detects new PAI 2.x releases
- Pulls upstream changes
- Applies to OpenCode installation
- Preserves USER customizations

### Why Deferred

- Need stable v1.0 baseline first
- Upstream detection requires GitHub API
- Migration strategies need per-component logic

### Workaround (v1.0)

Manual migration using converter:
```bash
bun Tools/pai-to-opencode-converter.ts \
  --source vendor/PAI/Releases/v2.x \
  --target .opencode \
  --mode selective
```

## 4. MCP Server Adapters

**Status:** Deferred to v1.x
**Priority:** P3 (Low)

### What It Does

MCP Server Adapters provide **external tool integration**:
- **deepwiki-enhanced**: GitHub repo Q&A via Devin API
- **Community MCP servers**: Various integrations from the MCP ecosystem

### Why Deferred

- OpenCode MCP server support needs testing
- MCP protocol compatibility unknown
- Authentication needs secure handling

### Workaround (v1.0)

Use external tools directly or via web interfaces.

## Contributing

Want to help implement deferred features?

1. **Check GitHub Issues** for feature discussions
2. **Read technical docs** for architecture details
3. **Start with tests** - verify OpenCode compatibility first
4. **Submit PRs** with tests and documentation

**Priority order:**
1. Voice Server (v1.1) - Clear use case, macOS only
2. Observability (v1.2) - High value, moderate complexity
3. Auto-Migration (v1.x) - Complex, needs stable baseline
4. MCP Adapters (v1.x) - Experimental
