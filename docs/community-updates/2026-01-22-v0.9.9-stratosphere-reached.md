# PAI-OpenCode v0.9.9: Stratosphere Reached

**Date:** 2026-01-22
**Version:** v0.9.5 → v0.9.9 (5 releases in 2 days)
**Status:** Approaching v1.0 Public Release

---

## The Journey So Far

What started as a simple port of Daniel Miessler's PAI 2.3 from Claude Code to OpenCode has evolved into something bigger: **a validated architecture pattern for platform-agnostic AI infrastructure.**

In the last 48 hours, we've pushed through 5 releases, each solving a layer of the migration puzzle.

---

## v0.9.5 → v0.9.9 Highlights

### v0.9.6: Security Hardening

Fixed a critical regex flaw that could have allowed `rm -rf /tmp` commands. Now ALL root-level destructive commands are blocked. Plus 18 path reference corrections across 8 files.

### v0.9.7: Two-Layer Migration Architecture

The crown jewel of this sprint. We built:

- **Layer 1: Extended Converter** with Validation Gate, Hook Discovery, Manifest Generation
- **Layer 2: MigrationValidator** - 27 automated checks that verify the migration

The Validation Gate is particularly clever: it shows you exactly what's about to change, calculates risk levels, and lets you decide before overwriting system files.

### v0.9.8: Documentation Consolidation

Renamed THEHOOKSYSTEM to THEPLUGINSYSTEM across the entire codebase. This isn't just a cosmetic change - it reflects OpenCode's architecture where hooks become plugins.

### v0.9.9: 12-Agent Audit Fixes

We ran a parallel 12-agent System-Integrity-Check audit and fixed every issue:
- Security validator case-sensitivity bug
- CORE/SKILL.md outdated path references
- Memory README directory naming
- Plugin configuration in opencode.json

## Architecture Achievements

### The Translator/Validator Pattern

```
PAI 2.3 (Claude Code)
        │
        ▼
┌───────────────────┐
│  CONVERTER v0.9.7 │ ← Layer 1: Translation
│  • Path rewriting │
│  • Hook discovery │
│  • Validation Gate│
└─────────┬─────────┘
          │
          ▼
┌───────────────────┐
│ MIGRATION         │ ← Layer 2: Verification
│ VALIDATOR         │
│  • 12 checks      │
│  • LLM analysis   │
│  • Self-tests     │
└─────────┬─────────┘
          │
          ▼
   PAI-OpenCode
```

This two-layer approach means migrations are **deterministic AND verified**. No more "it worked on my machine."

### The SYSTEM/USER Two-Tier Pattern

Established clear separation:
- **SYSTEM/** - Default configurations (upgradeable)
- **USER/** - Personal customizations (preserved)

This means future PAI updates can safely upgrade system files without touching your customizations.

## What's Left for v1.0

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| TUI Branding | ASCII art banner "PAI-OpenCode" instead of "OpenCode" |
| README Polish | Final images and installation guide refinement |
| Community Announcement | GitHub Release + Social Media |

## The Vision

PAI-OpenCode proves that **scaffolding transcends platforms**. The same architecture that makes Claude Code reliable can make OpenCode reliable. And Cursor. And any future AI coding assistant.

We're not just porting code. We're creating a blueprint.
