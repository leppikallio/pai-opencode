- Duplicate citation pressure stayed below tolerance with broad cid usage [@cid_gamma].

## Evidence
The synthesis references all validated cids and keeps numerical claims cited [@cid_alpha] [@cid_beta] [@cid_gamma].

## Caveats
This fixture proves offline determinism only and excludes live-web variability [@cid_alpha].
