# Epic E8 — Charter pack refresh (docs-only)

## Why
Architect raw-2: charter-pack docs drifted vs implementation (CLI location, already-finished workstreams).

## Outcome
Refresh charter-pack to match current reality and prevent “false gaps.”

## Deliverables
- Update WS1 + readiness gate references to canonical CLI and completed items.

## Validator gates
- Architect PASS (accuracy), QA PASS (docs validation + ref scan).
