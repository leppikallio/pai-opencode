# IEEE Citation Format - Complete Reference

## Purpose

This skill provides comprehensive IEEE citation format rules based on the official **IEEE Editorial Style Manual for Authors** (Updated July 29, 2024). All research agents and synthesis outputs must follow these rules for professional, consistent academic references.

## Source Authority

This guide is derived from:
- **IEEE Editorial Style Manual for Authors** (July 2024 edition)
- **IEEE Reference Guide** (Version 3.28.2025)
- Official IEEE Author Center resources

## Core Principles

### 1. Numbered Citation System

IEEE uses sequential numbered citations, NOT author-date format.

```
Correct:  Recent studies [1], [2] show...
Wrong:    Recent studies (Smith, 2024) show...
```

### 2. Order of Appearance

References are numbered in the order they are **first cited** in the text, not alphabetically.

```
First citation in text  -> [1]
Second citation in text -> [2]
Third citation in text  -> [3]
...and so on
```

### 3. One Reference Per Number

Each reference number corresponds to exactly ONE source. Do not group multiple sources under one number.

```
Correct:
[1] A. Smith, "First article..."
[2] B. Jones, "Second article..."

Wrong:
[1] A. Smith, "First article..."; B. Jones, "Second article..."
```

---

## In-Text Citation Rules

### Basic Citation Placement

```
Place citation number AFTER punctuation:
  "...as shown in the results [1]."
  "Several studies [1], [5], [8] confirm..."

Place citation number BEFORE colons/semicolons:
  "...the findings [3]: first, the model..."
```

### Citation Ranges

| Pattern | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| [1] | Single source |
| [1], [2] | Two sources |
| [1], [3], [5] | Non-consecutive sources |
| [1]-[3] | Three or more consecutive (using en-dash) |
| [1]-[3], [7], [9]-[11] | Mixed consecutive and non-consecutive |

### Specific Reference Citations

When referring to a specific part of a cited work:

```
Figure:    [1, Fig. 2]
Equation:  [1, eq. (8)]
Section:   [1, Sec. IV]
Theorem:   [1, Th. 4.2]
Chapter:   [1, Ch. 3]
Table:     [1, Table I]
```

### What NOT to Do

```
WRONG: "In reference [1], the authors show..."
RIGHT: "In [1], the authors show..."

WRONG: "Smith [1] demonstrated..."  (unless author name is essential)
RIGHT: "The study [1] demonstrated..."

WRONG: "In 2024, researchers found [1]..."  (date as identifier)
RIGHT: "Recent research [1] found..."
```

---

## Author Name Formatting

### Format Pattern

```
First initial(s). Surname
```

**Examples:**
- John Smith -> J. Smith
- Mary Jane Watson -> M. J. Watson
- Jean-Pierre Dupont -> J.-P. Dupont

### Number of Authors

| Count | Format |
|-------|--------|
| 1 | A. B. Surname |
| 2 | A. B. Surname and C. D. Surname |
| 3 | A. B. Surname, C. D. Surname, and E. F. Surname |
| 4 | A. B. Surname, C. D. Surname, E. F. Surname, and G. H. Surname |
| 5 | A. B. Surname, C. D. Surname, E. F. Surname, G. H. Surname, and I. J. Surname |
| 6 | A. B. Surname, C. D. Surname, E. F. Surname, G. H. Surname, I. J. Surname, and K. L. Surname |
| 7+ | A. B. Surname et al. |

**Important:** No comma before "et al."

## Special Cases

### Multiple Works by Same Author(s)

Each work gets its own reference number. Do not use "ibid." or similar.

### Secondary Sources (Citation within a Citation)

Avoid if possible. If necessary:
```
[#] A. Author, "Title," as cited in B. Author, "Title of citing work," ...
```

### Forthcoming/In Press

```
[#] A. Author, "Title," Abbrev. Title of Journal, to be published.
```

### No Author

Use organization name or title:
```
[#] "Title of document," Organization, Abbrev. Month Year.
```

### No Date

Use "n.d." (no date):
```
[#] A. Author, "Title," Publication, n.d.
```
