# Research Standards

Research outputs must be evidence-based and link-verified.

Non-negotiables:
- Verify URLs before presenting them
- Distinguish facts from speculation
- Prefer primary sources (docs, papers, vendor posts)
- Quote and cite when making strong claims
- For multi-turn research, rehydrate existing state before new collection
- Update persistent scratch artifacts each iteration (state, facts, open questions, next)

If you cannot verify a claim, say so explicitly.
