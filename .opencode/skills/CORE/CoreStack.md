# Core Stack

This is the canonical pointer for stack preferences.

Primary source of truth:
- `~/.config/opencode/skills/CORE/USER/TECHSTACKPREFERENCES.md`

Operational defaults (when preferences are unset):
- Prefer TypeScript for tooling and CLIs
- Prefer bun for JavaScript/TypeScript projects
- Favor deterministic code before prompts
