# Actions

This file defines shared "action" naming conventions used by workflows and pipelines.

## Action Naming

- Use short verb phrases (2-6 words).
- Prefer specific outcomes over generic verbs.

Examples:

- "Run runtime integrity check"
- "Deploy updated System workflows"
- "Scan repo for exposed credentials"
