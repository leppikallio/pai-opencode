# Aesthetic Register

This file is a lightweight registry for mapping a piece's emotional register to a visual treatment.

## Registers

- Dread: heavy, dense, oppressive linework
- Hope: light, ascending, open composition
- Contemplation: balanced, still, thoughtful spacing
- Urgency: fractured, dynamic, tense lines
- Wonder: light breaking through, contrasty highlights
- Determination: grounded posture, effort-visible marks
- Melancholy: fading, dissolving edges, trailing strokes
- Connection: warm, intimate, multiple figures close together
