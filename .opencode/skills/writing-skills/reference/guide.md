# Reference: guide.md (example)

This file exists to support the `writing-skills/anthropic-best-practices.md` document, which demonstrates a common skills pattern:

- Keep `SKILL.md` short.
- Put deeper material in `reference/` files that can be read on-demand.

In your own skills, replace this example with domain-specific guidance (API notes, conventions, schemas, edge cases).
