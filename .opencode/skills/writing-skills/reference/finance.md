# Reference: finance.md (example)

Example “finance reference” file used by `anthropic-best-practices.md` in the parent folder.

Use this pattern in real skills when you have finance-specific concepts that shouldn't bloat `SKILL.md`:

- Definitions (ARR, MRR, revenue recognition)
- Common queries/filters
- Gotchas (currency normalization, refunds, backfills)
