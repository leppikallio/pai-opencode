# Analyze (AnnualReports)

Analyze one or more downloaded reports for themes and trends.

## Steps

1. Fetch the reports you want to analyze (see `Fetch.md`).
2. Provide the report filenames and desired focus areas (e.g. ransomware, cloud, identity).
3. Summarize findings and cross-vendor overlaps.

Notes:
- This workflow is intentionally lightweight; analysis can be performed by reading PDFs and producing a structured summary.
