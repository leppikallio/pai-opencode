## DEPRECATED

This skill is a **compatibility alias only**.

- Canonical skill: `.opencode/skills/deep-research/SKILL.md`
- Keep this file for installs that still reference `deep-research-production`.

### Compatibility scope

- It is intentionally retained as a pointer only.
- The canonical skill contains the merged CLI and production workflow contracts.

# Deprecated shim for `deep-research`

The source-of-truth operator and production guidance now lives in:

- `.opencode/skills/deep-research/SKILL.md`
- `.opencode/skills/deep-research/Workflows/`

This file remains only for backward compatibility.
