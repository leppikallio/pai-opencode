# Workflow: DraftPerspectivesFromQuery (DEPRECATED)

This workflow is a **compatibility shim only**.

Use the canonical workflow instead:

- `.opencode/skills/deep-research/Workflows/DraftPerspectivesFromQuery.md`

This file remains for installs that still reference:

- `deep-research-production`

Do not use this document as source-of-truth for operator contracts.
