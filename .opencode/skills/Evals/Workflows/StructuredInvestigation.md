# StructuredInvestigation Workflow

## Purpose

Use this workflow when eval iterations stall and you need to challenge assumptions, metrics, and framing.

## Steps

1. Restate the goal in one sentence.
2. List 3 hypotheses for why progress stalled.
3. Define a falsifiable test for each hypothesis.
4. Run the smallest experiment for each test.
5. Update the eval plan based on results.

## Output

- A short writeup of the chosen hypothesis and the evidence.
- A concrete next eval iteration plan.
