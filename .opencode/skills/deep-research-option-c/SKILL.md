description: DEPRECATED compatibility alias; use the canonical deep-research skill.

## DEPRECATED

This skill is a **compatibility alias only**. New workflows and canonical behavior are in `deep-research`.

- Canonical skill: `.opencode/skills/deep-research/SKILL.md`

---

### Compatibility note

- Keep this skill for existing installs that still reference `deep-research-option-c`.
- This file intentionally does not duplicate source-of-truth workflows.

---

# Deprecated shim kept for compatibility
### Pointers

- Canonical workflows (merged): `.opencode/skills/deep-research/Workflows/`
- CLI still lives at `.opencode/pai-tools/deep-research-option-c.ts`

Use this shim only as an alias. For full contracts, workflows, and quality gates, use `deep-research`.
