# RunPlan Workflow (DEPRECATED)

This workflow is a **compatibility shim only**.

Use the canonical workflow instead:

- `skills/deep-research/Workflows/RunPlan.md`

This file remains for installs that still reference:

- `deep-research-option-c`

Do not use this document as source-of-truth for operator contracts.
